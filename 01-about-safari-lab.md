# Hands On with safari Kubernetes sandbox

We will use safari kubernetes sandbox as a Hands On platform. This platform enables us to interact with a remote kubernetes cluster using any browser. 
We don't need to install anything in our computer. If you have kubernetes clusters like `minikube`, `microk8s` in your local computer, you can continue using that.
Although the safari sandbox have some limitation, but for most of the topics we wanted to cover in this session we can use it.   

Steps to follow:  

Step 1:  Login to Ultimatix 

Step 2:  Login to Safari https://www.ultimatix.net/uxportal/uxportalhome.html/landingPage?landingPath=%2FuxContent%2FlandingPages1%2FSafariDigicore.html

Step 3:  Visit the Sandbox Page https://learning.oreilly.com/scenarios/kubernetes-sandbox/9781492062820/

Step 4:  Launch the Sandbox

Step 5: In the command prompt, do clone this repository since there are many samples present in this repository `git clone https://github.com/anirbansingharoy/k8s-workshop.git`

Step 6: Type `docker login` in the command prompt.(Username: k8sworkshop07jul, Password: Will be shared during the session) 

**Note**: There won't be any backup for the new files you will create in that sandbox environment. It will be erased if you close the browser window or reload the window. 
Make sure you take backup of the configuration file(Which you think you need to refer later) manually in your local computer.

There were some tools available like `minikube`, `micro-k8s` which helps you to spin up a kubernetes cluster in your local.
